    <p>Here is a Miles Davis lick over the tune Oleo on the Bag's Groove album. This lick showcases how one can think of a simple tonal center over fast changes which can make simple ideas sound more colorful.

Analysis:

For the first four bars the changes are I-iv-ii-V repeated twice. The I is replaced with a iii the second time around but it can still be thought of as the same chord.

For the first 2 bars, Davis plays a lick that can be viewed as a pentatonic lick, or a lick consisting of the I arpeggio (Bb maj) with the added 9th extension (C). This lick is repeated over the two sets of I-iv-ii-V with the rhythm slightly varied. Rhythm variations can make huge changes to simple lines and I encourage people to explore different ways of playing melodies.

For the next 4 bars, the section has a I-V/IV-IV-#IVdim which then leads back to another I-iv-ii-V.
For this section you can view this lick as an enclosure that leads to the 6th degree of the IV chord and then descends down the scale. The line ends with a inverted I arpeggio. This lick can also be viewed as an enclosure to the 6th of the IV chord and then you think of IV lydian dominant for the two chords in the 2nd bar.

To simplify the whole A section of Oleo, one can think of I pentatonic licks (Bb major) for the I-iv-ii-V sections and Eb lydian dominant for the IV-#IVdim.
The Bb7 in bar 5 can be highlighted as a dominant but you can also keep thinking Bb pentatonic.

The extra sheet music shows variations on the ideas listed. For example, if you think of the first part of the lick as a  I (Bb major) arpeggio with the added 9th (C), you can invert this Bb major arpeggio while still keeping the 9th. Another variation was using a iii (Dmin) arpeggio with the added 9th degree (E) and all its inversions. The last variation is the lick shifted to different degrees of the pentatonic scale.
