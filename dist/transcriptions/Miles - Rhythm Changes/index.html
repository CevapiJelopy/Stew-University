  <p>Here is a Miles Davis lick over the tune Oleo on the Bag&#39;s Groove album. Use this as an example of thinking within a tonal center through several changes.</p><h3>Analysis:</h3><p>For the first four bars the changes are <b>I-iv-ii-V</b> repeated twice. The <b>I</b> is replaced with a<b> iii </b>the second time around but it can still be thought of as the same chord.</p><h5>For the first 4 bars</h5><p>Davis plays a lick that can be viewed as a <b>pentatonic lick</b>, or a lick consisting of the <b>I arpeggio (Bb maj)</b> with the added 9th extension (C). This lick is repeated over the two sets of<b> I-iv-ii-V</b> with the rhythm slightly varied. Rhythm variations can make huge changes to simple lines and I encourage people to explore different ways of playing melodies.</p><h5>For the next 4 bars</h5><p>The section has a<b> I-V/IV-IV-#IVdim</b> which then leads back to another <b>I-iv-ii-V</b>.
For this section you can view this lick as an enclosure that leads to the <b>6th degree</b> of the <b>IV chord</b> and then descends down the scale. The line ends with a inverted <b>I arpeggio</b>. This lick can also be viewed as an enclosure to the <b>6th</b> of the <b>IV chord</b> and then you think of <b>IV lydian dominant</b> for the two chords in the 2nd bar.</p><h5>Summary</h5><p>To simplify the whole A section of Oleo, one can think of <b>I pentatonic licks (Bb major)</b> for the<b> I-iv-ii-V </b>sections and <b>Eb lydian dominant</b> for the <b>IV-#IVdim</b>.
The <b>Bb7</b> in bar 5 can be highlighted as a dominant but you can also keep thinking <b>Bb pentatonic</b>.</p><p>The extra sheet music shows variations on the ideas listed. For example, if you think of the first part of the lick as a  I (Bb major) arpeggio with the added 9th (C), you can invert this Bb major arpeggio while still keeping the 9th. Another variation was using a iii (Dmin) arpeggio with the added 9th degree (E) and all its inversions. The last variation is the lick shifted to different degrees of the pentatonic scale.
